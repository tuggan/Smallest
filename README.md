# Smallest Challenge

A collection of my personal projects focused on creating the smallest viable
implementation for various concepts and challenges. I'm fascinated by the
process of distilling ideas down to their absolute essence and building them
back up from there.

## Projects

This repository currently holds the source code and documentation for the
following smallest viable implementations:

* **[Reverse Shell](reverse_shell)**: The smallest possible reverse shells
intended for pentests

## Philosophy

My aim with these projects is not necessarily to create the *most* efficient or
feature-rich solutions, but rather to explore the fundamental building blocks
and understand the core mechanics of different systems and algorithms. This
often involves stripping away unnecessary complexity and focusing on the
absolute minimum required for functionality.

## Contributing

While these are primarily personal explorations, I'm always open to discussing
ideas and approaches. If you have suggestions for even smaller viable
implementations or insights into the existing projects, feel free to open an
issue or start a discussion.
